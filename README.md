This is Ramin Mohajernoe. I'm a python developer and I developed this project for Mashhad Municipality, Iran.
The GUI helps to generate demand profiles and other related transportation measures using the automatic AFC data of Mashhad system.
The first tab is about finding out each smart-card owner's gender (only the front end is mine),
the second tab is about to finding the transportation measures in both design and analysis (both front end and back end is mine),
the fourth tab relates to prediction (only the front end is mine),
the fifth tab is about finding the OD matrix of all network (both front end and back end is mine).
